# Consumption Pattern Analysis

This project aims to analyze credit/debit card consumption patterns and predict future consumption using advanced AI algorithms.

## Project Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset files.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for data processing and model training.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/consumption-pattern-analysis.git
    cd consumption-pattern-analysis
    Download credit card transactions data and save file name as credit_card_transactions.csv:
    https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ealtman2019/credit-card-transactions?select=User0_credit_card_transactions.csv
    ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook notebooks/consumption_analysis.ipynb
    ```

## Usage

1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Perform feature engineering.
3. Train the model and make predictions.
